Fly me to the moon,
Let me sing among the stars.
And let me see what spring
Is like on Jupeter and Mars.
In other words, hold my hand.
In other words, baby kiss me.

Fill my heart with song,
Let me swing forevermore.
You are all I long for,
All I worship and adore.
In other words, please be true.
In other words, i love you.

Fill my heart with song,
Let me sing forevermore.
You are all I worship,
All I long for and adore.
In other words, please be true.
In other words, in other words,
I love you!
